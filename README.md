# Implementation-of-various-MOSFET-models-and-MOSCAP-CV-characteristics-in-Matlab-Tool-
Implemented Pao-Sah ,Brews and Piece-wise model for NMOS and PMOS transistor in MATLAB and did a qualitative comparision of all the models. 
Analysed high frequency and low frequency CV characteristics of MOSCAP device in Matlab by varying various parameters like gate workfunction, oxide thickness and channel doping. â€¢ Modified the developed code to include effects of positive &amp; negative fixed charges and interface traps and analysed their effects on CV characteristics.
