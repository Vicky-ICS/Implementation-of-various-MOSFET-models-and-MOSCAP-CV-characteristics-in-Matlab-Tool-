A code to generate HFCV and LFCV curves for NMOS and PMOS capacitors. Input variables: Gate workfunction, oxide thickness, channel doping and type (NMOS or PMOS). 

Generated CV curves for different MOS parameters .

Another code to extract MOS capacitor parameters from the CV curve that I generate from the above code. 

Modified the earlier developed CV code (HFCV and LFCV) to include effects of fixed charges (positive and negative, do separately) and interface traps. Consider fixed oxide charge density of 2x1012 /cm2 and interface trap density of 3x1012 /cm2 (both located at the Si/SiO2 interface). Use TOX = 2.2 nm and NA = 3*1017 / cm3.
